# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project uses Semantic Versioning with an Ultra prerelease suffix
while it tracks the bundled D Research core version.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Created D Research Ultra as the prebuilt multi-agent distribution of
  D Research.
- Added a runtime-neutral Ultra layer:
  - `agents/manifest.json`
  - `agents/spawn-contract.md`
  - `agents/orchestrator.md`
  - six portable worker role files under `agents/subagent-roles/`
- Added execution modes for fast, standard, and completeness-first work.
- Added the wave-based completeness-first pipeline:
  1. Source Mapper + Public Web & Community Hunter
  2. Recall Auditor + Data Extractor
  3. Evidence Verifier
  4. Report Synthesizer
- Added a standalone README for the Ultra package.

### Changed

- Reframed the package as runtime-neutral. Core instructions no longer
  require a specific CLI, command name, or vendor agent API.
- Renamed the previous public-social worker to
  `Public Web & Community Hunter` to keep the base preset broad,
  lawful, and less niche.
- Rewrote `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the orchestrator playbook around
  a generic host-runtime spawn contract.
- Replaced the previous main-expert backup file with a compact portable
  Main Research Agent reference.

### Notes

- D Research Ultra bundles the D Research core methodology and can be
  installed alone.
- Host adapters may translate the portable role files into their own
  subagent/task/worker format.
- If a runtime has no real worker mechanism, the main agent still runs
  the D Research core workflow and manually applies the role checklists.

## [3.1.0-ultra.1] - 2026-06-05

# Execution Gates

Use these gates as a portable quality controller before synthesis. They capture
the strongest parts of orchestrated agent workflows without requiring MiniMax,
any specific model vendor, subagent runtime, or single research domain.

The gates reduce false completeness. They do not promise exhaustive Internet
coverage, and they never relax the safety boundary in
`references/safety-and-access-policy.md`.

## When to Apply

Apply the gates to any non-trivial research task, source-discovery task,
dataset collection task, public URL analysis, market or technical research,
academic review, public-role person aggregation, or answer that makes multiple
factual claims.

Keep the gates lightweight or skip them when a narrower branch already fits:

- Atomic fact lookups covered by `references/fact-verification.md`.
- Public social-media post capture covered by `references/social-media-archival.md`.
- Refusal or safety-boundary decisions where no source access is allowed.
- Very small single-source summaries where the user explicitly asks for speed
  and the answer is clearly marked as limited to that source.

## Operating Principles

- **Domain-neutral by default.** Gates should improve research across technical,
  academic, legal, financial, government, market, product, and local-language
  work. Do not force social/person workflows onto unrelated tasks.
- **Subagents are optional.** If the host runtime offers subagents, use them as
  independent reviewers. If not, the main agent performs the same checklists.
- **The main agent owns the merge.** Never blindly trust worker summaries.
  Deduplicate mirrors, reconcile conflicts, and preserve useful leads that a
  synthesizer might otherwise drop.
- **No access escalation.** A gate failure is a reason to search better,
  downgrade confidence, or report blockers, not a reason to bypass login walls,
  paywalls, captchas, rate limits, robots restrictions, or access controls.
- **Completeness is scoped.** Report reachable-evidence coverage and remaining
  gaps. Never claim total web coverage.

## Gate 1: Source Map Gate

Pass this gate when the run has a source map with:

- the task interpretation and major assumptions;
- entities, aliases, synonyms, versions, dates, locations, and source classes;
- candidate URLs or source classes for each major sub-question;
- access status when known: accessible, partial, blocked, login-required,
  paywalled, captcha, rate-limited, robots-restricted, broken, or unknown;
- the likely evidence each candidate can provide;
- the query or path that found each candidate;
- source-quality expectations: primary, official, original, secondary,
  mirror/reprint, community, social, archive, or unknown.

If the gate fails, build or repair the source map before extracting data.

## Gate 2: Coverage and Recall Gate

Use this gate when the answer would otherwise rely on thin discovery.

Triggers:

- fewer than three independent credible sources were found for a broad or
  multi-claim answer;
- fewer than three relevant source basins were checked;
- all useful evidence comes from one source basin;
- the answer depends on snippets, mirrors, reposts, or secondary summaries;
- the topic is obscure, old, local-language, historical, or long-tail;
- the first pass exposed names, aliases, versions, article titles, distinctive
  phrases, datasets, files, APIs, citations, or related entities that were not
  searched directly;
- the user asks for "deep research", "find all", "verify carefully",
  "collect sources", "maximum recall", or similar completeness language.

A source basin is a narrow evidence cluster, for example:

- official website or documentation;
- public data portal, API, registry, or filing;
- academic database or cited paper set;
- source code repository, release notes, issues, or discussions;
- government or standards source;
- one news outlet or media group;
- one community/forum/Q&A platform;
- one social or public-profile platform;
- archive, mirror, reprint, or aggregator;
- one time period, language variant, name variant, or geography.

Pass this gate when the run has either:

- checked the relevant basins for the task;
- found independent support across multiple basins;
- escalated once to `references/frontier-search.md` for documented gaps; or
- explicitly marked remaining basins as blocked, unavailable, irrelevant, or
  out of scope.

If the gate fails, run a recall pass:

1. Extract anchors from current evidence: exact names, aliases, titles, unique
   phrases, dates, versions, organizations, authors, domains, IDs, files,
   endpoints, citations, locations, and related entities.
2. Generate a different query plan from the first pass.
3. Try targeted follow-up queries across exact phrase, site-specific,
   file/API/dataset, official/primary, archive/mirror, contradiction, local
   language, and related-entity variants.
4. For audit-grade or user-requested maximum recall work, try at least ten
   targeted follow-up queries or document why fewer are sufficient.
5. If no new source appears, include the follow-up queries in the search trail
   and mark the answer as partial where appropriate.

Do not finalize a non-trivial answer from a single basin while claiming broad
coverage. Either continue discovery or state the limitation plainly.

## Gate 3: Identity, Date, and Inference Gate

Use this gate whenever claims involve people, organizations, products, versions,
schools, roles, dates, locations, historical events, social/public sources, or
same-name ambiguity.

Pass this gate when:

- each date, year, age, role, release, version, affiliation, or status claim is
  directly supported by source text or clearly marked as inference;
- same-name entities have been disambiguated with positive evidence, not only
  search ranking or partial name matches;
- article publication dates are not converted into event dates, school years,
  product release dates, or birth years unless a source states that explicitly;
- generational labels, grade/class labels, and approximate descriptors are
  reported as written rather than converted into exact facts;
- social, forum, or community leads are labeled as confirmed, likely, possible,
  uncertain/same-name risk, or likely different when identity matters;
- stale pages, mirrors, reprints, and duplicate reports are not counted as
  independent confirmation.

If the gate fails, downgrade confidence, split verified facts from inference,
or continue verification before synthesis.

## Gate 4: Evidence Verification Gate

Break the draft answer into atomic claims. For each important claim, verify:

- exact source URL or explicit unavailable/blocked marker;
- source title or stable label;
- source type and source basin;
- access method and extraction method;
- date/version/snapshot when relevant;
- evidence quote, value, selector, row, API field, or other anchor;
- contradiction status;
- confidence and caveat.

Prefer primary, official, original, recent, and directly accessible sources.
Use secondary sources to find primary sources, not as final authority when a
primary source is available.

If a claim cannot be tied to evidence, remove it, mark it as inference, or
downgrade confidence.

## Gate 5: Synthesis Readiness Gate

Before final output, confirm:

- source map exists or the task is explicitly small enough not to need one;
- search trail lists important queries and source paths tried;
- URLs opened or extracted are recorded separately from sources found only by
  search snippets;
- evidence ledger or evidence summary covers important claims;
- contradictions, stale sources, mirrors, duplicates, and confidence downgrades
  are visible;
- blockers and partial sources are reported with manual retrieval instructions
  when useful;
- coverage gaps are named;
- output does not overclaim completeness;
- final answer separates verified facts, inference, uncertainty, and unavailable
  data.

If any item fails, either continue the workflow or label the result as partial.

## Optional Worker Roles

When the host supports subagents or parallel workers, these roles are useful.
They are optional implementation details, not required dependencies.

| Role | Use when | Required output |
|---|---|---|
| Source Mapper | Starting non-trivial source discovery. | Source basins, exact queries, candidate URLs, access states, why each source matters, gaps. |
| Recall Auditor | Recall is thin, long-tail, old, local-language, contested, or single-basin. | Independent follow-up query plan, new candidates, duplicates/mirrors, blocked leads, remaining recall gaps. |
| Public Source Hunter | Public social/community sources are relevant and privacy-safe. | Public URLs, access states, identity labels, privacy caveats, blockers, next queries. |
| Data Extractor | Sources contain tables, files, APIs, embedded data, PDFs, or reusable datasets. | Structured output, schema/data dictionary, extraction method, coverage, quality checks. |
| Evidence Verifier | Factual claims, dates, identities, roles, versions, or contradictions matter. | Claim-level verification table with confidence and caveats. |
| Report Synthesizer | Multiple worker outputs need a final user-facing report. | Direct answer, evidence summary, blockers, contradictions, confidence, next steps. |

The main agent remains accountable for merging worker outputs, resolving
conflicts, and enforcing privacy and safety boundaries.
